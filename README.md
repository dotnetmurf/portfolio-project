# portfolio-project
This repository contains my final project for the Microsoft Introduction to Web Development course on 
Coursera. This project was developed in the Microsoft VS Code IDE using GitHub Copilot as a coding assistant,
per course requirements.

## Overview

This project workspace contains the following key files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the portfolio website.
- **styles.css**: Contains all custom styles to define the look and feel of the site.
- **script.js**: Handles interactive features and dynamic content for the portfolio.
- **images/**: Directory containing images used throughout the website.
- **README.md**: Project documentation and instructions.

Each file is organized to support a modular and maintainable web development workflow.

### index.html

The `index.html` file is the main landing page of the portfolio website. It structures the content, links to stylesheets and scripts, and provides the foundation for all visible elements on the site.

### styles.css

The `styles.css` file defines the visual appearance of the portfolio website, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design elements to ensure a consistent and attractive user experience across devices.

### script.js

The `script.js` file adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to the portfolio website, enabling features such as navigation, animations, and user-driven content updates.
